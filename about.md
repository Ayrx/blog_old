Hello! My name is Terry. I go by the handle Ayrx online.

I am a 20 year old guy with a strong interest in all things related to
information security. I am a Python person as well. I hack on a Python
cryptography library confusingly named
[Cryptography](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) during my free time. I also
hang out on an awesome site called
[Information Security Stack Exchange](http://security.stackexchange.com/).

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in talking. My email is in the
sidebar and I'm usually on IRC as well.

Cheers!
